## Overview

A command-line tool for interacting with [BlueKing](https://bk.tencent.com/) platform APIs. It is built for **developers, automation workflows, and agent integrations**, with structured JSON as the default output. Built-in bk-cli commands that perform remote requests or updates support `--dry-run`, and `--help` includes real-world examples. Third-party plugins define their own arguments and output contracts.

For the full design contract, see [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).

## Features

- **Three layers of invocation**: raw API calls, system subcommands, and shortcuts (planned)
- **Multi-context support**: manage credentials for multiple BlueKing deployments
- **Environment diagnostics**: use `bk-cli doctor` to check contexts, credentials, URL rendering, and gateway connectivity
- **Automation-friendly output**: JSON envelopes with an `ok` field, machine-readable errors, and predictable exit codes
- **Rich system commands**: built-in BlueKing system subcommands, with raw `api` calls kept as a fallback
- **Embedded agent skills**: inspect version-matched usage guidance with `bk-cli skills list` and `bk-cli skills read <name>`; use `skills read --raw` for raw Markdown
- **Third-party CLI plugins**: install reviewed standalone CLIs from the built-in approved catalog and call them through bk-cli
- **Encrypted credential storage**: AES-256-GCM encryption per context
- **Single host binary**: bk-cli itself has no runtime dependencies; third-party plugins are installed separately

## Quick Start

- [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md)

For developers:

- [Development Environment Setup](docs/develop-environment-guide.md)
- [Extension Development Guide](docs/develop-extension-guide.md)

## Common Commands

### Third-party CLI plugins

bk-cli ships an approved plugin catalog. Install a reviewed third-party CLI and call it through bk-cli:

```bash
bk-cli plugin list
bk-cli plugin install bkms
bk-cli bkms --help
bk-cli --context clouds bkms <bkms arguments>
```

Only `--context` may appear before the plugin name. Everything after it, including output and exit code,
belongs to the plugin. When bk-cli fails before starting the plugin it exits with 125 and prints a JSON error on stderr.
Offline installs: `bk-cli plugin install bkms --from-file <official archive>`.
